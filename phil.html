                The Dining Philosopher's Problem is a classic concurrency problem that demonstrates resource allocation and synchronisation concerns. It's like imagining a group of philosophers sitting around a table, each with a bowl of rice and chopsticks to eat with. However, there are only a limited number of chopsticks, with one chopstick between each pair of adjacent philosophers.
                The issue arises when each philosopher begins to eat with their chopstick and the chopstick next to them. If all philosophers pick up their chopsticks at the same time, a deadlock can occur in which each philosopher waits for the chopstick to their right to be released.
